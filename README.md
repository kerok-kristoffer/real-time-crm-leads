# real-time-crm-leads
This project aims to automate the capture of newly created leads via CRM webhooks, wait for a short buffer period (e.g., 10 minutes), and then assign the correct lead owner based on CRM-updated information. The system also notifies the sales team in real time with enriched lead data via Slack or email.
